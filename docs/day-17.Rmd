# Read in Cities Data
cities = read_csv("~/github/geog176A-daily-exercises/data/uscities.csv") %>%

# Get Bounding Box and make sf object
cities_bb = st_bbox(cities)

```


This raster shows the elevation of Goleta, California. The bbox values indicate the x min and max and range from -2145000 to -2160000 on this scale and the y values range from 1532000 to 1540000. The z value indicates the zoom above this plane, which was set at 13, and the scale on the right indicates the elevation in meters.
